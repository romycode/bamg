# bank-manager (WIP)

This is a practical project to learn golang.

This API only have six endpoints without any type of security, see the api.http file to see all.

To run the code copy and paste this line, inside the project folder:

```bash 
make run
```

If you only want to build the API, run these:

```bash
make build 
```

These would run the api in http://localhost:8080

To run the test execute:

```bash
make test
```
